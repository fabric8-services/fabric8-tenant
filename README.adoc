## Service for initializing and updating the tenant services in fabric8/openshift.io

The YAML for the tenant services is defined in the following projects:

* che : https://github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-tenant-che
* jenkins : https://github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-tenant-jenkins
* team : https://github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-tenant-team

### Testing YAML

When a PR is made on one of the above YAML repos you can test in production in your tenant via the following:

* http://openshift.io/ and login
* go to your Profile page (click the top right drop down and select `Profile`)
* add `/_tenant` to your browsers address bar - so you will be looking at a URL like https://openshift.io/my-user-name/_tenant
* enter the PR version number (it should be reported in a comment on the PR) along with the maven repo that the PR has been pushed to
* click `Update Profile`
* now https://github.com/openshiftio/openshift.io/wiki/FAQ#how-do-i-update-my-tenant-[Update Tenant] - you're tenant should now be running the PR

To go back to using the default YAML:

* go back to your tenant page like https://openshift.io/my-user-name/_tenant
* click `Clear Values`
* click `Update Profile`
* now https://github.com/openshiftio/openshift.io/wiki/FAQ#how-do-i-update-my-tenant-[Update Tenant] and you should be back to the default versions

### Unit Testing Go

Tips to running unit tests - this command seems to work on OS X:

```
make clean && make && make deps && glide update && make test-unit
```


### Rapid development on Minikube / Minishift

If you run fabric8 in minikube or minishift then you can get rapid feedback of your code via the following:

  * Install fabric8 platform first by running following:

```
git clone https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8-platform.git
cd fabric8-platform
./install.sh
```

  * Run the app using the `:dev` docker image label:

```
cd apps/init-tenant
mvn fabric8:deploy  -Pdev
```

  * Use the `kube-redeploy` make target whenever you want to create a new docker image and redeploy

```
make kube-redeploy
```

**Note**: If the docker build fails you may need to type this first to point your local shell at the docker daemon inside minishift/minikube:

```
eval $(minishift docker-env)
```
